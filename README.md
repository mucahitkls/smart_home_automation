# Smart Home Automation System

## Project Overview

The Smart Home Automation System is a comprehensive solution designed to bring advanced automation and control to various household devices like lights, thermostats, TVs, and security systems. Using the command design pattern, the project aims to create a flexible, scalable, and easily maintainable structure that allows for the addition of new device types and functionalities.

### Status: Under Development

This project is currently under development. As such, some features and functionalities are in the process of being implemented, tested, or refined.

## Key Features

- **Device Control**: Manage and control different smart devices, including lights, thermostats, TVs, and security systems.
- **Command Design Pattern**: Utilize the command design pattern for executing actions on devices, allowing for scalability and flexibility in adding new device types and commands.
- **RESTful API**: Interact with the system through a well-defined RESTful API, facilitating easy integration with various clients (e.g., web or mobile applications).
- **Database Integration**: Maintain device states, user preferences, and schedules in a robust PostgreSQL database.
- **User Management**: Manage user accounts, including authentication and authorization for different operations.

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Python, Flask or FastAPI (for creating the API), SQLAlchemy (for database interactions)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic
- **Logging**: Python's built-in logging module

## Project Structure

- **/models**: Contains SQLAlchemy models defining the structure of database tables.
- **/schemas**: Includes Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization.
- **/commands**: Holds the command classes following the command design pattern for device operations.
- **/receivers**: Defines the receiver classes representing the devices being controlled.
- **/api**: The API layer handling HTTP requests and integrating with the command and receiver layers.
- **/tests**: Contains unit and integration tests for the application.

## Usage (Under Development)

> Note: The usage instructions and examples will be provided once the project reaches a stable state.
